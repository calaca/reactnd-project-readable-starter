# Client-Side App

## Installing

To install and start the client-side app, run the following commands in this directory:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

### NPM scripts

- `npm run start`: runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build`: builds the app for production to the `build` folder
- `npm run test`: runs the test watcher in an interactive mode
- `npm run eject`: ejects the app so you have full control over configuration files and the transitive dependencies
